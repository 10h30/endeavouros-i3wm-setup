# Firefox starting automatic on each login? 

# Does that annoy you a lot ???


!! To disable autostarting firefox with this readme edit `~/.config/i3/config` and comment out this line:

`#exec --no-startup-id firefox https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup/blob/main/README.md`

`~/.config/i3/config` is the main configuration file for i3, get into this file and configure i3 as you ike, all settings have comments to give you information about the following setting.
